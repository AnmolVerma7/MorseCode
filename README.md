# MorseCode

The MorseCode program is a simple console-based application that allows users to encode English sentences into Morse code and decode Morse code into English. The Morse code standard used by the program uses 3 spaces to separate letters and 7 spaces to separate words.

## Features

- **Encode English to Morse Code:** The program can take an English sentence as input and convert it into Morse code.
- **Decode Morse Code to English:** The program can take Morse code as input and convert it into an English sentence.

## Usage

When you run the program, it starts a console-based interface. The user interface asks you to enter an option - 'E' to encode a message, 'D' to decode a message, or 'Q' to quit the program. Based on your selection, the program will ask for the message to encode or decode and will display the resulting encoded or decoded message.

## Classes

The program uses several classes to handle different aspects of the encoding and decoding process:

- `MorseCodeApp`: This is the main class that runs the entire program, handling user input and output.
- `MorseEncoder`: This class handles the encoding of English sentences into Morse code.
- `MorseDecoder`: This class handles the decoding of Morse code into English sentences.

Note: For a complete understanding of the program's functionality, please refer to the comments in the source code.
